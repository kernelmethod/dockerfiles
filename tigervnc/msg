TigerVNC server for accessing desktops run in Docker containers.
----------------------------------------------------------------
To configure VNC for $user, you can execute the following commands
(either in your Dockerfile or when you run the container):

    # Alternatively, run
    #
    #   mkdir -p ${HOME}/.vnc \
    #   && bash -c "vncpasswd -f <<< $vnc_password > ${HOME}/.vnc/passwd
    #
    # if you don't want to have to type the password in from stdin.
    vncpasswd

    # You could also COPY a key and certificate from a local file
    openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout ${HOME}/.vnc/vnc.key \
        -out ${HOME}/.vnc/vnc.cert -days 365 -subj '/CN=${USER}' -nodes

A convenience script that automates this process has also been added to
this container. You can run it with

    add-vnc-user username [vnc-password]
