wshand/noVNC
noVNC server run in a Docker container.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is the base image for multiple Docker containers that provide
desktop access through a NoVNC server. In order to run it, you must first
install some kind of desktop that you can serve over VNC.

From there, you should run `/usr/bin/vncserver` followed by
`/usr/local/bin/launch-novnc` in order to start the NoVNC server. You
may also need to generate a password for your user to access the server
(which is made a little easier through an add-vnc-user script).

ex:

    /usr/local/bin/add-vnc-user $password

    /usr/bin/vncserver \
        -xstartup /etc/vnc/xstartup

    # Note: ${NOVNC_DIRECTORY} is an environmental variable that
    # points to the directory containing the files (code, HTML, etc.)
    # for NoVNC.
    /usr/local/bin/launch-novnc \
        --web ${NOVNC_DIRECTORY} \
        --vnc localhost:5901
