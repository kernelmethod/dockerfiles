wshand/lxqt-vnc
TigerVNC server for accessing an LXQt desktop run in a Docker container.
----------------------------------------------------------------
To configure VNC for $user, you can execute the following commands
(either in your Dockerfile or when you run the container):

    # Alternatively, run
    #
    #   mkdir -p ${HOME}/.vnc \
    #   && bash -c "vncpasswd -f <<< $vnc_password > ${HOME}/.vnc/passwd
    #
    # if you don't want to have to type the password in from stdin.
    vncpasswd

    # You could also COPY a key and certificate from a local file
    openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout ${HOME}/.vnc/vnc.key \
        -out ${HOME}/.vnc/vnc.cert -days 365 -subj '/CN=${USER}' -nodes

A convenience script that automates this process has also been added to
this container. You can run it with

    add-vnc-user username [vnc-password]

To start a VNC server, you can run a command along the lines of the following:

    vncserver \
        -geometry 1200x800 \
        -localhost no \
        -X509Key ${HOME}/.vnc/vnc.key \
        -X509Cert ${HOME}/.vnc/vnc.cert \
        -xstartup /etc/vnc/xstartup

The most important component of this is to set -xstartup to /etc/vnc/xstartup,
unless you know what you're doing. You can run vncserver -h to see more options.
