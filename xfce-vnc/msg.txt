wshand/xfce-vnc
Ubuntu container for running Xfce sessions over TigerVNC.
-----------------------------------------------------------------
To use this container, create a Dockerfile that starts with

    FROM wshand/ubuntu-xfce-vnc:latest

Now to configure VNC for $user, first run

    mkdir -p ${HOME}/.vnc

to create the .vnc directory for $user. Then, create some self-signed
TLS certificates so that you encrypt session traffic. For instance,
you could run

    openssl req \
        -x509 \
        -newkey rsa:4096 \
        -keyout ${HOME}/.vnc/vnc.key \
        -out ${HOME}/.vnc/vnc.cert \
        -days 365 \
        -subj '/CN=localhost' \
        -nodes

If you're okay with hard-coding your credentials for your VNC sessions,
you can add

    bash -c "vncpasswd -f <<< '$password' > ${HOME}/.vnc/passwd"

to your Dockerfile. You can start a VNC session at runtime with something
along the lines of

    vncserver \
        -geometry 800x800 \
        -PasswordFile ${HOME}/.vnc/passwd \
        -xstartup /etc/vnc/xstartup \
        -localhost no \
        -X509Key ${HOME}/.vnc/vnc.key \
        -X509Cert ${HOME}/.vnc/vnc.cert

See `vncserver --help` for an explanation of all of the available options.
