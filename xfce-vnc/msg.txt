wshand/xfce-vnc
Ubuntu container for running Xfce sessions over TigerVNC.
-----------------------------------------------------------------
To use this container, create a Dockerfile that starts with

    FROM wshand/xfce-vnc:$tag

(where $tag is debian or ubuntu). To configure VNC for $user, first run

    usermod -a -G ${VNC_GROUP} $user
    mkdir -p ${HOME}/.vnc

If you're okay with hard-coding your credentials for your VNC sessions,
you can also add

    bash -c "vncpasswd -f <<< '$password' > ${HOME}/.vnc/passwd"

to your Dockerfile. You can start a VNC session at runtime with something
along the lines of

    vncserver \
        -geometry 800x800 \
        -PasswordFile ${HOME}/.vnc/passwd \
        -xstartup /etc/vnc/xstartup \
        -localhost no

See `vncserver --help` for an explanation of all of the available options.
Regardless of the options you pick, make sure that you set the -xstartup
flag to be /etc/vnc/xstartup.
